Hello, I am a data scientist at apple and I work on deep learning projects.
I() !a also maintain a blog in my free time with many of my old tutorials.
My personal research interests include sequence to sequence processing tasks.
This is a rather wide subfield and is growing ever wider.
I eventually want to solve the ability to reason with logic so that we can build platforms that can start to make strategic decisions across a wide array of situations.
I also enjoy playing tennis, cooking, weight lifting.
My favorite shows include the Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, Shark Tank and Dragon Ball.
I am originally from New Jersey but currently live in California while my parents live in Georgia.
I have a little brother who is in middle school and it is somewhat unfortunate that I am not able to be by his side when he is high school.
Which is arguably some tested times in a teenager's life.
